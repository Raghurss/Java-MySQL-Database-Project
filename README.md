Implementing this twice is enough to get an out-an-out idea mainly over Java and also MySQL.
Java is used here to simulate the products category and MySQL for the purpose of querying.
Xampp is used to initialise the server and MySQL database i.e PHPMyAdmin ( in this case).
Populating the JTable from MySQL Database and a preview of navigating buttons.
Hope this helps someone out there.
